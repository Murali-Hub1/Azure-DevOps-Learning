Azure DevOps - CD Setup

-> Implementing Continuous Deployment (CD)
    -Created release pipelines.
      -created 'update-shellscript' file where if there is any change in code it should update to Git.

-> Deploy to Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) for CD
    -Created an AKS cluster (GUI)
    -Attached AKS nodes (VM Scale Sets)
    -Applied Kubernetes manifests
    -Configuring Virtual Machine Scale Sets as Node pools in AKS
    -Why I used:
      -Kubernetes is the industry standard for container orchestration
      -Scaling, reliability, and service discovery are automatic

-> GitOps with Argo CD
    -Argo CD watches Git
    -Syncs deployment state to AKS
    -Why I used:
      -Deployment state stored in Git
      -Auditable changes can update quick

-> Kubernetes Manifests
    -Deployment YAML
    -Service YAML
    -ConfigMaps
    -Secrets
