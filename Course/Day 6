Azure Networking Interview Q&A

- What is the difference between NSG and ASG ?
    ASGs are applied to VMs and are used in conjunction with NSGs. By associating an ASG tag with NSG, you can define rules that apply to a group of VMs sharing the same tag.

- How can you block the access to a your vm from a subnet ?
    By default traffic is allowed between subnets with in the VNet in Azure. The priority of this rule is 65000, so we need to create a Deny rule with less than 65000 priority number.

- What is the difference between Azure Firewall and NSG ?
    Firewall: Designed for controlling both outbound and inbound traffic to and from resources within a Virtual Network (VNet).
    NSG: Typically associated with subnets or individual network interfaces to control traffic within a VNet and between VNets.

- What is the difference between Azure User Data and Custom Data ?
    User data persists and lives in the cloud, accessible and updatable anytime. 
    Custom data vanishes after first boot, accessible only during VM creation.

- What is the difference between Azure App Gateway and Azure LB ?
    Azure Application Gateway:
      Operates at Layer 7 (Application layer) of the OSI model. 
      Provides advanced application-level routing, SSL termination, and web application firewall (WAF) capabilities. 
      Suited for distributing traffic based on application awareness.
    Azure Load Balancer:
      Operates at Layer 4 (Transport layer) of the OSI model. 
      Distributes network traffic based on IP address and port. 
      Suitable for generic TCP/UDP load balancing without application-specific features.

Azure Storage concepts:

- Azure Blob Storage:
    It is designed to store and manage large amounts of unstructured data, such as documents, images, videos, and other types of binary and text data.
    Azure Blob Storage to store artifacts and binaries produced during the build process, ensuring a centralized and scalable storage solution.

- Azure File Storage :
    It provides the Server Message Block (SMB) protocol for sharing files across multipel applications and VMs in the Azure cloud.
    In a deployment pipeline, scripts or configuration files stored in Azure File Storage can be mounted to VMs or containers during the deployment process.

- Azure Tables:
    NoSQL data store service provided by Azure. It stores large amounts of semi-structured data and allows for fast and efficient querying using a key-based access model
    Data is organized into tables, and each table can store billions of entities, suitable for scenarios like storing configuration data, user profiles, and other data where a key-value or key-attribute data model is appropriate.

- Azure Queue Storage
    allows decoupling of components in a distributed application. It provides a reliable way to store and retrieve messages between application components, ensuring asynchronous communication.
    scenarios like handling background jobs, managing tasks asynchronously, and facilitating communication between loosely coupled components.
    During deployment, scripts can enqueue messages to trigger specific actions or coordinate tasks between different components.
