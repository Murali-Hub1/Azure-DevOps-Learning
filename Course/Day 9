Azure DevOps - CI Setup

-> Hands-on DevOps real-time project with multiple components, cloned from DockerSamples:
    -Frontend — Python app for voting
    -Redis — for capturing votes
    -.NET worker — processes votes
    -Postgres Database — to persist data
    -Node.js app — shows live results
These represent a typical microservices architecture used in real apps, ideal for practicing DevOps.

-> Azure DevOps Project Setup
    -Created an Azure DevOps Organization
    -Created a DevOps Project
    -Added the code into Azure Repos (Git)

-> Azure Container Registry (ACR) Setup
    -Created and connected DevOps pipeline to Azure Container Registry to store built Docker images.
      ACR holds all built Docker images
      Deployment pipelines pull from ACR
      Supports container-based applications

-> Azure Pipeline creatinon (CI)
    -Created YAML pipeline for result, vote and worker.
    -Stages like:
      -Build Docker images
      -Push images to ACR
        trigger:
          path:
            include:
              - vote/* or result/* or worker/*

        pool:
          name: 'self-hosted'

        steps:
          - script: docker build 
          - script: docker push 

-> Self-Hosted Agent
    -Created azure lunix VM
    -Registered it with Azure DevOps agent pool
    -Used it in pipelines

-> Dockerfile defined:
    -For vote, result, worker:
      -FROM — base image
      -COPY — add source
      -RUN — install dependencies
      -EXPOSE — expose service ports
      -CMD or ENTRYPOINT — startup commands
