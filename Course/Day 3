Virtual Network : VNet in Azure is a logically isolated network that securely connects Azure resources and extends on-premises networks. 
  Key features include:
    - Isolation : VNets provide isolation at the network level for segmenting resources and controlling traffic.
    - Subnetting: Divide a VNet into subnets for resource organization and traffic control.
    - Address Space: VNets have an address space defined using CIDR notation, determining the IP address range.

Subnets : are subdivisions of a Virtual Network, allowing for better organization and traffic management.

CIDR : notation represents IP addresses and their routing prefix, specifying the range of IP addresses for a network.

Routes : dictate how network traffic is directed, specifying the destination and next hop.

Route Tables : are collections of routes associated with subnets, enabling custom routing rules.

Network Security Groups : NSGs are fundamental for Azure's network security, allowing filtering of inbound and outbound traffic. 
  Key aspects include:
    - Rules: NSGs define allowed or denied traffic based on source, destination, port, and protocol.
    - Default Rules: NSGs have default rules for controlling traffic within the Virtual Network and between subnets.
    - Association: NSGs can be associated with subnets or individual network interfaces.

Application Security Groups : ASGs group Azure virtual machines based on application requirements, simplifying network security.
  - Simplification: ASGs allow defining rules based on application roles instead of individual IP addresses.
  - Dynamic Membership: ASGs support dynamic membership based on tags or other attributes.
  - Rule Association: Security rules can be associated with ASGs for intuitive and scalable network security management.

Installing Jenkins in Azure VM step by step

Azure CLI installed and logged in, vm login
- az login
- az vm list --query "[].{Name:name,RS:resourceGroup}" --output table
- az vm start --resource-group "RGNAME" --name "VMNAME"
- ssh -i 'PATH' azureuser@'IP'

Commands to install Java and Jenkins
- sudo apt update 
- sudo apt install openjdk-17-jre
- java -version
- curl -fsSL https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian/jenkins.io-2023.key | sudo tee \
  /usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc > /dev/null
echo deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc] \
  https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian binary/ | sudo tee \
  /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jenkins.list > /dev/null
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install jenkins

By default, Jenkins will not be accessible to the external world due to the inbound traffic restriction by Azure. 
Open port 8080 in the inbound traffic rules as show below.
- Azure VM >> Network Settings >> Bottom of tab >> Add inbound traffic rules
