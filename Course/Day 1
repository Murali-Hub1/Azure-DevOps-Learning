Public Cloud : Shared digital space for everyone.
Private Cloud : Your own exclusive digital space.
Hybrid Cloud : Using both your private space and the shared online space when needed.
Cloud Computing : Cloud computing is a technology model that involves the delivery of computing services over the internet. Instead of owning and maintaining physical servers and infrastructure.
Virtualization :  is the process of creating a virtual version of something, such as an operating system, server, storage, or network resources.
Hypervisor : is virtualization software that enables multiple operating systems to run on a single physical machine
Virtual Machine : is a software-based emulation of a physical computer. It allows running multiple operating systems on a single physical machine.
API : is a set of rules and protocols that allows different software applications to communicate with each other. It defines how software components should interact.
Regions : in cloud computing refer to geographic locations where cloud providers have data centers
Availability Zones : are isolated locations within a region that have their own power, cooling, and networking.
Load Balancing : is the distribution of network traffic or computing workload across multiple servers to ensure no single server is overwhelmed.
Scalability : is the ability of a system to handle an increasing amount of work or its potential to be enlarged to accommodate that growth.
Elasticity : in cloud computing refers to the ability to dynamically scale resources up or down based on demand.
Agility : is the capability of quickly and easily adapting to changes. In the context of cloud computing, it involves the rapid deployment of resources and applications.
High Availability : ensures that a system or application is operational and accessible for a high percentage of time, typically 99.9% or higher.
Disaster Recovery : involves the planning and processes for restoring and recovering data and systems after a natural or human-induced disaster.
Fault Tolerance : is the ability of a system to continue operating without interruption in the presence of hardware or software failures.
